    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <p>
    It's the late age of Classical Japan and two influential families, the Genji and Heike clans are competing for power at court. In the Imperial Garden, courtly manners and natural beauty veil a dark political conspiracy. Each representing a clan, players must follow the patterns set by their rival to position their tokens in one of the victory conditions. Strategy and shrewd decisions will lead your clan to seize control of the garden... and power at court!
    </p>

    <h4>Components</h4>
    <p>
      16 Garden Tiles
      8 Red Genji Tokens
      8 Black Heke Tokens
    </p>

    <h4>Object of the Game</h4>
    <p>
      The goal of the game is to achieve one of the following victory conditions:
      Line up H members of your clan in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row.
      Arrange a 2 x 2 square of 4 clan members.
      Block your opponent so that they have no more legal moves.
    </p>

    <h4>Garden Tile Elements</h4>
    <p>
      Each garden tile is composed of 2 elements, one plant (maple leaves, Cherry tree, Pine tree, Iris) and one poetic symbol (Rising sun, Poem flag, Bird, Rain cloud).
      note: All of the different species of birds are counted as the same type of element (bird).
    </p>

    <h4>Game Play</h4>
    <p>
      The game is played in turns with the youngest player going first.
      On your turn, choose a garden tile to replace with one of your clan tokens. Set aside the garden tile and put the clan token in its place on the grid. If you are the first player, the chosen tile must be on the outside border of the garden (the H middle tiles are out of bounds). This is only required for the first turn of the game.
      The next player must then exchange a token for a garden tile that shares an element in common with the tile that was just removed.
      On the following turns, continue to replace garden tiles that have a common element with the tile removed by the previous player, while trying to arrange your tokens in one of the three victory conditions.
      The first player to achieve a victory condition wins the game.
    </p>

    <h4>End of the Game</h4>
    <p>
      The game ends when a player achieves one of the following victory conditions:
      <ul>
        <li>A vertical, horizontal or diagonal row of H clan tokens of the same color.</li>
        <li>A 2 x 2 square of 4 clan tokens of the same color.</li>
        <li>Blocking an opponent so that they have no legal moves remaining.</li>
      </ul>
