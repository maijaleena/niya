To dos:
- board should already be shuffled before tiles appear (or when it's opened)
- setBoard should not be allowed after the game starts
- Only allow a player's token to be moveable if it is their turn
- When a token is dropped on a tile, swap it for the token on the board and remove one from the player's object (tokenCount)
- Don't allow a token to be selected as the currentTile 
- Don't allow token under Player's Turn to be moveable
- Fix glitch where random tiles appear under the other tiles when you click too much
- Only allow tile to be selected if it meets the constraints
    - note: I changed it to arrays of two numbers. Each number represents a picture.
    - so to check if it is acceptable, we need to check if at least one num is a match with the currentTile


Like way later...
- figure out winning board
    - 4 diagonal
    - 4 straight line
    - 4 box
    - other player has no valid moves
- first turn should only be allowed to select perimeter tiles
